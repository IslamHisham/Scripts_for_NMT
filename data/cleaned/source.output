secure an improper advantage of any kind .

a " facilitation payment " is a payment to a government official designed to secure or speed up a routine government action to which the applicant is entitled , such as : processing a visa , scheduling an inspection , securing mail pick - up or delivery , or getting utilities connected .
this is sometimes described as " greasing the wheels " or " grease payments . "
